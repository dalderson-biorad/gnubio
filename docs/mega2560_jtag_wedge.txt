MEGA2560 Jtag Wedge

To make debugging the ATMega2560 bootloader a bit easier, an arduio Mega260 was wired
to an AVR JTAGICE3 emulator. This allows for line debugging over JTAG. Further testing was accomplished
erasing Slave 1 and connecting the I2C bus and a ground connection between the GNUBio target hardware
and the Mege2560 board.
